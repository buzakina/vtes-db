<h5>WHY</h5>
<p>Because being active VTES player I want to have the tool at my disposal with clean interface and corresponding to my flow in card search.</p>
<p>There are several great tools around, but I was not completely happy with any of it - this one is not an exception (that is why it is still evolving).</p>
